Transition rules (this is the real wiring)
1️⃣ New (Unreviewed) → Accepted

Who: Dispatcher
Must be true:

Core load fields are filled

RateCon is attached

Dispatcher has reviewed OCR or manual entry

In human terms:

“I’ve looked at this and trust it.”

This is human authority, not automation.

2️⃣ Accepted → Dispatched

Who: Dispatcher
Must be true:

Carrier has acknowledged the load
(ratecon accepted / driver confirmed)

In human terms:

“Someone outside our system has committed.”

This prevents fake or premature dispatch.

3️⃣ Dispatched → In Transit

Who: Dispatcher (or driver action that dispatcher trusts)
Must be true:

Pickup confirmed OR dispatcher manually advances

In human terms:

“The truck has the freight (or is rolling).”

You allow flexibility here on purpose.

4️⃣ In Transit → Docs Pending

Who: Dispatcher
Must be true:

Delivery occurred

In human terms:

“The load is done moving.”

Docs may still be missing — that’s the point.

5️⃣ Docs Pending → Complete (Unverified)

Who: Dispatcher
Must be true:

All required documents are uploaded

In human terms:

“We have paperwork — now we need to check it.”

No quality judgment yet. Just presence.

6️⃣ Complete (Unverified) → Ready to Bill

Who: Dispatcher
Must be true:

Human has reviewed docs

Nothing missing or rejected

In human terms:

“This won’t blow up accounting.”

This is the money safety gate.

7️⃣ Ready to Bill → Billed

Who: Dispatcher (or accounting role later)
Must be true:

Invoice sent OR factoring submitted

In human terms:

“Money process has started.”

After this, the load is frozen forever.

About moving loads backward

Backward moves are allowed, but never silent.

Rule (simple, don’t code yet):

Any backward transition requires:

Dispatcher action

Reason / note

Examples:

Complete (Unverified) → Docs Pending (bad POD)

Ready to Bill → Complete (Unverified) (doc issue caught)

Accepted → New (entered wrong load)

This protects you during audits and “what happened?” moments.
